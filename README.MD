# ft_vox

this project is a minecraft clone made in C++ with OpenGL in the context of my studies at 42 School.

## what has been made

- Window Management
- Player Movement
- Chunk Generation (techninal part)
- Skybox Rendering
- Text Rendering (informations, chat and commands)

## what I need to do

- World Generation (add feature to the world like see, moutains, etc ...)
- Gameplay (destroy and place blocks, inventory, craft, etc ...) => it's more in ft_minecraft, another 42 project but anyway

## features I want to add
- lines in chunk border in F3 mode to see the delimitation
- I don't know how it's called, but something to see camera orientation in F3 mode
- multiples camera angle to play (implied player body)

## Bug knowns

- tp command is probably broken
