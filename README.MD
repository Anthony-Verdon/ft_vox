# ft_vox

this project is a minecraft clone made in C++ with OpenGL in the context of my studies at 42 School.

## my reflexion

I decided to note everything I think about this project on Miro: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVK6B1Tlo=/?share_link_id=193715330065
## what has been made

- Window Management
- Player Movement
- Chunk Generation (techninal part)
- Skybox Rendering
- Text Rendering (informations, chat and commands)

## what I need to do

- World Generation (add feature to the world like see, moutains, etc ...)
- Biome map
- Gameplay (destroy and place blocks, inventory, craft, etc ...) => it's more in ft_minecraft, another 42 project but anyway

## features I want to add
- lines in chunk border in F3 mode to see the delimitation
- I don't know how it's called, but something to see camera orientation in F3 mode
- multiples camera angle to play (imply player body)
- sound 
- multiplayer
- fog for long distance

## Bug knowns

feel free to test my program if you want to !
